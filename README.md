Hi there! I'm @sandhya8109 👩‍💻
Welcome to my 15-Day Python Code Challenge repository—a collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python projects and exercises completed as part of my Udemy learning journey.

🔍 About the Challenge
This challenge was designed to sharpen my core Python skills by building small, functional programs every day. Each file in this repo is a hands-on coding task that helped me explore Python basics like:

Variables & Data Types

Functions and Conditionals

Loops & Logical Operations

Lists, Dictionaries, Sets

String Manipulation

File I/O

Object-Oriented Programming

And more!
